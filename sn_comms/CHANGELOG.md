## v0.1.0 (2023-01-20)

### Chore

 - <csr-id-95ae6f9e8e30184a24465a35626288af64d7995e/> add Peer to UnknownPeer conn Err
 - <csr-id-b8dbee25acfd5b0f348f06419f8058742f575953/> remove Option around send watcher
 - <csr-id-dbfa4ac0dd23e76060b8df44c4666a30bb9b317f/> replace node comms with sn_comms
 - <csr-id-a86d5ad1f352c9000488197ece8edb716941d601/> make a new crate for comm

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b5e57d5b3d91849074a90f5ba671d9b19b7e4461/> prohibit creating PeerSession to unkown node
 - <csr-id-3d8070155bb88b7403ae97730b33510b8c3af685/> introducing Cmd::SendNodeMsgResponse for NodeMsg responses to nodes over streams
   - Having this internal sn_node::Cmd to handle sending msg responses to nodes over
   a response bi-stream allows us to decouple such logic from the rest, but it also
   allows us to have unit tests within sn_node which verify the outcome of processing
   Cmds without sending any msg over the wire.
   - We are here also changing Cmd::SendMsg to make/restricting it exclusively for
   sending msgs to nodes over uni-streams.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-28cdebb4b05c5d64dcbe8dfb39a72c88fd2c28bd/> update comm members on AE msg in
 - <csr-id-0cbcc1dddf7db229b7fb81328108a076263343d2/> handle sending msgs off the incoming msg loop
   This should prevent us blocking qp2p should a channel itself be blocked

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-9aaf91bfedd9fcf040f18e0762ff2cbbc03b4d6f/> forward client data cmds/queries to holders through Cmd::SendMsgAndAwaitResponse
   - Unifying and simplifying logic to send client data cmds and queries to holders so in both
   cases the sn_node `Cmd::SendMsgAndAwaitResponse` is used.
   - Renaming `sn_comms::Error::CmdSendError` to `SendError` since it's not specific for
   cmds but for any msg.
   - Some internal sn_node helper functions were moved to different files/mods so they are closer
   to the logic making use of them.
